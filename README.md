# Makompile

Makompile is a website compiler. It compiles very simple markdown-like `.txt` files
into a static website with navigation, autogenerated index, wiki-like links and a few
other neat features. This markdown variant is designed to be very easy to use, read
(both compiled and in plaintext) and to remember. I made it because I wanted to use it.

Actually Makompile as a whole is very easy to use. You can use Makompile to create your
own websites too!

Makompile documents are written in plain `.txt` files. Easy to read, easy to edit.

Check the documentation [here (txt format)](https://github.com/Lartu/makompile/blob/main/source/makompile.txt)
or [here (html format)](https://lartu.net/makompile.html). It's quite short, I promise.

Pull requests are welcome, as are bug reports, issues or whatever.
